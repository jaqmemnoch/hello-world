# hello-world

Hello, I'm Jose Anthony, jaqmemnoch for the online community. I'm in my path to get acquainted with this platform and to start coding as a full time career. Coding has always been easy for me and it was just a hobby until to a few months ago. Now, life has shown me that I should make better use of my natural skills.
